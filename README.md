# <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">My Very First Landing Page</span>

This README file provides information about a landing page project created as part of "The Odin Project" curriculum. The goal of this project is to improve HTML and CSS skills by designing a landing page for a free online games website.

## Project Description

The landing page will serve as the main entry point for visitors to the free online games website. It will provide a visually appealing and informative introduction to the website's offerings and encourage users to explore further. The project will involve the use of HTML and CSS to structure and style the page.

## Image Sources

To enhance the visual appeal of the landing page, images will be sourced from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com), a popular website that offers a wide range of high-quality, royalty-free images. By utilizing images from Pixabay, the landing page will have an engaging and professional appearance.

## Development Environment

The project will be developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular source code editor known for its versatility and extensive plugin ecosystem. VS Code provides a user-friendly interface and numerous features that enhance the development process, making it an ideal choice for this project.

### Instructions for Setting Up the Development Environment
